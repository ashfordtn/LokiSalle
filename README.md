# Weddings Venues Rental Project Website

**This is an experimental website, created to learn more about PHP, this website still has some missing functionalities but overall it's 80% done, this was made with a low knowledge of PHP and created in a very short timeframe, around 3 days to be exact with almost no prior deep knowledge about PHP, therefore the code might seem messy and I know, CSS is a total mess, but structure and cleanliness wasn't my goal creating this project, no structure models were followed, just going with the flow getting the idea done.**
